# AI-BOM Toolkit

A toolkit and visualizer for **AI Bill of Materials** (AI-BOM). Pipe any CycloneDX AI-BOM JSON into the `aibom` CLI and get an interactive constellation graph.

TL;DR how to use AI-BOM:

```sh
snyk aibom --experimental --json | npx aibom --view
```

_What it does: Snyk generates a CycloneDX AI-BOM as JSON, which is piped into the `aibom` CLI. The `--view` flag opens an interactive HTML visualization of your AI bill of materials in the browser._

## Why AI-BOM

AI-powered systems are increasingly widespread, but understanding what's inside those models, including their components, data sources, dependencies, and risks—remains difficult. The **AIBOM CLI** helps developers by:

- **Transparency**: Instantly visualize the full "system composition" of your AI applications: AI models, datasets, libraries, and supply chain dependencies.
- **Debugging & Operations**: Find complex model dependencies to speed up troubleshooting and locate source-code usage of AI components in your AI/ML projects.
- **Adoption with Existing Tools**: Seamlessly integrate with tools like Snyk to generate and visualize AI-BOMs—no vendor lock-in, just pipe your JSON in.

The CLI turns complex JSON reports into an interactive constellation graph—making architectural risk, component drift, and dependency relationships easily explorable for all engineers involved in building, deploying, or reviewing AI-enabled software.

## Deployed Version

The AI-BOM Visualizer is also deployed live here for public use: [https://ai-bom-visualizer.vercel.app](https://ai-bom-visualizer.vercel.app)

## Quickstart for AI BOM Visualizer package

To visualize your AI-BOM in your own local environment, pipe a valid CycloneDX JSON data to the `aibom` npm CLI utility as follows:

```sh
cat data.json | npx aibom --view
```

If you're using Snyk to create an AI-BOM:

```sh
snyk aibom --experimental --json | npx aibom --view
```

## Quickstart for Developers of AI BOM Visualizer website

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # → dist/index.html (single file, all assets inlined)
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

Default BOM comes from **`data.json`** at project root (injected into the HTML at build time); edit it and rebuild to change the default graph. See [docs/project.md](docs/project.md) for build and data source details. To build a data-free viewer for another project to inject their BOM later, use **`npm run build:template`** — see [docs/html-template.md](docs/html-template.md).
